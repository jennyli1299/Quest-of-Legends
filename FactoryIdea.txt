One way that we could have implemented a factory in this project would have been to change our Monster class into an interface and then had all of our subclasses  simply implement Monster instead of inheriting from it. We then could have created a MonsterFactory that we could pass in the highest level of the hero's on the board in order to decide which monsters we would spawn on the nexus every 8 rounds. The reason we did not do this was because it would need us to rework the entirety of our Monster.java and the respective subclasses.
